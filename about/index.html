<h3 id="methodology-used">Methodology Used</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>We are using the Agile Methodology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/group-project/images/agile-methodology.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="step-1"><font color="#ffd599">Step 1</font></h4>

<p>The first step of our methodology is <font color="#ffffc2">planning</font> out the requirements of our project. We have already done this by conducting <font color="#ffffc2">research</font> and deciding that we will create an Ivy League Acceptance Rate calculator. We have come to the conclusion, through <font color="#ffffc2">design</font>, that there will be fields in which the user inputs their personal data and then based on that the calculator will calculate their chance of getting into each Ivy League college.</p>

<h4 id="step-2"><font color="#db9d7f">Step 2</font></h4>

<p>The second step of our methodology is <font color="#ffffc2">planning</font> out the sprints and how those will work. Sprints are a certain length of time that is dedicated to developing the program. During this step in the methodology, we will <font color="#ffffc2">plan</font> out what we will accomplish in the set amount of time and what we will accomplish in future sprints. This will be <font color="#ffffc2">tracked</font> with the usage of a team <font color="#ffffc2">scrum board</font>, which will contain the tasks we need to complete as well as the tasks we have completed. This scrum board will also contain <font color="#ffffc2">milestones</font>, <font color="#ffffc2">features</font>, and <font color="#ffffc2">versions</font> that need to be implemented as we develop the program.</p>

<h4 id="step-3"><font color="#6d788f">Step 3</font></h4>

<p>In this step of our methodology, we will work together to <font color="#ffffc2">design</font> and develop our program so that it becomes functional and user friendly. We will <font color="#ffffc2">code</font> a user interface that is easy to use and clearly labeled with what to do in order to use the program correctly. We will also work on how the program will run by <font color="#ffffc2">planning</font> the javascript and python that powers the program.</p>

<h4 id="step-4"><font color="#666991">Step 4</font></h4>

<p>In this step of our methodology, we will use sprints to work on the project and integrate changes that we decide as we create and test the program. This will be done by <font color="#ffffc2">coding</font> in multiple languages, including html, css, javascript, and python. We will also use this time to <font color="#ffffc2">review</font> and integrate user feedback in order to improve the programâ€™s user friendliness and to make the program easier to use. This step is critical in creating a successful product that is well made.</p>

<h4 id="step-5"><font color="#65676b">Step 5</font></h4>

<p>In this step of our methodology, we will deploy our program to the public and let them <font color="#ffffc2">test</font> out the program. If they encounter any problems while using the program, there will be a way for them to submit feedback which we can use to improve our program or make changes to the way it functions. From there we can <font color="#ffffc2">repeat</font> the methodology, starting from step 2.</p>

<h3 id="project-requirements">Project Requirements</h3>
<blockquote>

  <p>For every project, there need to be requirements for what the project should do and how it should do it. Here is a list of our project requirements:</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="main-purpose">Main Purpose</h4>

<p>We want this project to have student-inputted data that is used to calculate their chances of getting into each Ivy League college.</p>

<h4 id="inputted-values">Inputted Values</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Intended Major</font>
    <p>this will help determine the chance that they have of getting into a college because each college has different acceptance rates based on the major that the student applies for</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">GPA (Unweighted)</font>
    <p>this is a major part of determining acceptance rate since this is determined by how well one does in school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">SAT and ACT Scores</font>
    <p>this is also a very important part that is going to be used to determine the percent chance the user has of being accepted into those colleges because these are standard tests that are used throughout the US and some parts of the world</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Gender</font>
    <p>this is also an important part to help determine the percentage because this factor is considered in the college admissions process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Ethnicity</font>
    <p>this, like gender, is also considered in the college admissions process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Extracurriculars</font>
    <p>this is also an important part in determining the chance of one getting into a college because it shows the involvement that the student has had throughout their schooling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Leadership Positions</font>
    <p>this, like extracurriculars, is very important in determining the percentage of a student getting accepted because it shows their involvement in the community</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="computer-systems-used">Computer Systems Used</h3>
<blockquote>

  <p>Throughout the development process we will use multiple systems and programs to develop the program. Below we have listed some of the tools we are using for this project.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="computer-systems">Computer Systems</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>This is what we will be using to code and develop the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Windows Computer</font>
    <p>each person will have their own computer which will have a Linux virtual machine installed with VSCode, which will be used to code and develop the program</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">VSCode</font>
    <p>this program will be used to code the program and push versions out to GitHub</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">GitHub</font>
    <p>we will be using this to host our code on the internet so that we can all easily access an up-to-date version of the program</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Discord/Slack</font>
    <p>these programs will mainly be used for communication between team members so that we can all work together to create the program without conflict</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Fastai Fastpages</font>
    <p>this is what we will host the program on so that it is available to the public</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Coding Language</font>
    <p>we will mainly use HTML, Javascript, Python, CSS, and Markdown to code the program and website that is hosting the program</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tracking-tools">Tracking Tools</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>These tools will mainly be used to track what we need to get done and when we need to get it done by. This will be useful in documenting the process as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">GitHub</font>
    <p>this is also useful for creating a Scrum Board, which will be used to document and establish what needs to be done in order for everything to work smoothly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Discord/Slack</font>
    <p>this will again help the team communicate so that we can easily come to conclusions without needing to figure out what each person is doing at any given time</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="consumer-targeting">Consumer Targeting</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>This will be used to target certain consumers as well as gain feedback from users in order to improve the program and create a better product.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Meetings</font>
    <p>we will have both meetings with users as well as meetings among our team in order to see what the consumers want as well as what we as the developers want in order to make this project very well made</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Demos</font>
    <p>we will use demonstrations to potential consumers in order to show off our program and gather data on what the public wants to see in our program</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Feedback Collection</font>
    <p>in order to gain feedback on what people want to see in our program, we will use surveys on which they can either rate our program and state what improvements we could make or they could report bugs they see in our program in order for us to work them out</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sprint-development">Sprint Development</h3>
<blockquote>

  <p>During each sprint, we will need to code, test, and deploy our program, using certain techniques and tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>In order to document the development process, we will be using GitHub Issues. These will help us organize our Scrum Board, as well as document updates and goals that we have during each sprint session.</p>

  <p>We will also blog about our experiences and findings on a weekly basis on this Fastpages site. This will allow for users of the program that are also interested in our processes to easily access our journey. This will include screenshots of the code, as well as explanations of what we did.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="feature-expectations">Feature Expectations</h4>
<blockquote>

  <p>Features are what we expect the program to contain and do in order for it to reach its intended goals. This means that the program will have features in both the front-end and back-end section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/group-project/images/features.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These are some of our features and below we have described each feature.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Project Documentation</font>
    <p>this is where we will document on Fastpages what we have done each week and how we have done everything</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Textboxes and Buttons</font>
    <p>these are part of the user interface and are how the user interacts with the program in order to receive an output</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Data API</font>
    <p>this is what will hold the data that will be used to determine the percentage that the students have of getting into each college</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#ffffc2">Reading Textbox and Button Input</font>
    <p>this will be how the program gathers data from the user and compares it to the data in the API, from which the program will calculate the percentage that the student has of getting into each college</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these features will be expected to have a minimal amount of code, as we want efficiency in our program. We will also have feature reviews and demos from which we will obtain feedback and improve the features or add new features that the consumers want to see. We will do this every sprint meeting when we decide what we will work on for the week.</p>
