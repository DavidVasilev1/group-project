# Week 1 Summary

## Scrum Master
>
This week, I completed the plan for what we will be doing in [Workflow](https://davidvasilev1.github.io/group-project/about/). I stated what each of our roles are and what we will be doing through the methodology that we have chosen. I stated the project requirements, as well as the systems and tools we will be using throughout development. I also stated how we will be working to constantly update the program, as well as implement suggestions given by the consumers.
 
## DevOps
>
This week, I completed the entire layout of how the project is going to work for our group. This included the authoring tool methods, the planned integration of programming languages in our project, our github sociology (how the branches are going to work), and our methods for deployment and testing. These components are going to be extremely important in the future when we are working on key components of our project.
