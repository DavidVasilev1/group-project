# Week 1 Summary

## Scrum Master
>
This week, I completed the plan for what we will be doing in [Workflow](https://davidvasilev1.github.io/group-project/about/). I stated what each of our roles are and what we will be doing through the methodology that we have chosen. I stated the project requirements, as well as the systems and tools we will be using throughout development. I also stated how we will be working to constantly update the program, as well as implement suggestions given by the consumers.

This week, I completed the entire layout of how the project is going to work for our group. This included the authoring tool methods, the planned integration of programming languages in our project, our github sociology (how the branches are going to work), and our methods for deployment and testing. These components are going to be extremely important in the future when we are working on key components of our project. 

## Front-End
>
This week, I worked on the frontend side of the calculator page that we are attempting to create. I utilized an integration of HTML and JavaScript on our FastPages site to create dropdown menus for the user to input their personalized answers to the questions on the calculator. I also worked on the frontend design artifacts and made sure to consider certain possibilities of the user having limitations that may not allow them to complete the questions in the traditional calculator.

## Back-End
>
This week, I worked hard on creating our own API. First, I created a Google Sheet which was worked on by the entire group. This contained the data regarding each of the Ivy League colleges for each of the factors that we are including in the user processed input. Then, this was exported into a CSV file and proper progress was made on the API's creation. 

# Week 2 Summary

## Scrum Master
>
This week I completed the user interface with the help of the frontend, Samit. On the frontend, we added dropdowns, sliders, and textboxes for the users to enter their data, which will be used to calculate their chances for each college. We also added information pop-outs for the user to click on and read when they are unsure of what data to enter into the program. We also styled everything to make it easy to use and follow when used. Here is a link to the [user interface](https://davidvasilev1.github.io/group-project/project?). I also created a scrum board to keep track of all the things we need to do and what things we have already done.

I updated the scrum board with the tasks that I have to complete with Akshat (backend). On the frontend, I also assisted with creating the college application essay rubric (along with its button on the homepage), as it is a part of the calculator as a whole. 

## Front-End
> This week, I worked on the frontend side of the calculator page. Together, with David (Scrum Master), we utilized JavaScript and HTML in order to better the dropdown and slider mechanisms. We are currently working on working with the obligations of English learners by developing an algorithm that successfully allows user to translate all the English words to Spanish. Other languages are being considered. We have altered the design artifacts slightly in order to better compensate with a more enhanced UI.
