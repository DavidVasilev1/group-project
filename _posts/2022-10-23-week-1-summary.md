# Week 1 Summary

## Scrum Master
>
This week, I completed the plan for what we will be doing in [Workflow](https://davidvasilev1.github.io/group-project/about/). I stated what each of our roles are and what we will be doing through the methodology that we have chosen. I stated the project requirements, as well as the systems and tools we will be using throughout development. I also stated how we will be working to constantly update the program, as well as implement suggestions given by the consumers.
